/**
  * The maximum size in bytes for append operations to the video.js
  * SWF. Calling through to Flash blocks and can be expensive so
  * tuning this parameter may improve playback on slower
  * systems. There are two factors to consider:
  * - Each interaction with the SWF must be quick or you risk dropping
  * video frames. To maintain 60fps for the rest of the page, each append
  * must not  take longer than 16ms. Given the likelihood that the page
  * will be executing more javascript than just playback, you probably
  * want to aim for less than 8ms. We aim for just 4ms.
  * - Bigger appends significantly increase throughput. The total number of
  * bytes over time delivered to the SWF must exceed the video bitrate or
  * playback will stall.
  *
  * We adaptively tune the size of appends to give the best throughput
  * possible given the performance of the system. To do that we try to append
  * as much as possible in TIME_PER_TICK and while tuning the size of appends
  * dynamically so that we only append about 4-times in that 4ms span.
  *
  * The reason we try to keep the number of appends around four is due to
  * externalities such as Flash load and garbage collection that are highly
  * variable and having 4 iterations allows us to exit the loop early if
  * an iteration takes longer than expected.
